# Neural-Machine-Translation-with-RNNs
This project converts sentence in its source language to the target language. It encodes a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) network with attention, to build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system. Training procedure for proposed NMT system uses a Bidirectional LSTM Encoder and a Unidirectional LSTM Decoder.
